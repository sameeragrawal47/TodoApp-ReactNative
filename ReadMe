    Steps to setup:
        Download and clone the project
        I have used Firebase as backend, you will need firebase dependency
        Open terminal and Navigate to project’s directory
        Type this command in same terminal: npm install firebase —save
        Open another terminal, Navigate to project’s directory and run following command:
        react-native run-ios or you can also open project in Xcode and click on Run
